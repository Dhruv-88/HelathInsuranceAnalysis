# Health Insurance Premium Analysis

This project focuses on analysing insurance premium charges using a dataset containing insured individuals' attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region. With 1338 rows of data and no missing values, this dataset provides an ideal opportunity for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Introduction
Healthcare costs are a significant concern for individuals and families worldwide. Understanding the factors influencing insurance premium charges can help insurance companies optimize pricing strategies and assist individuals in making informed decisions about their healthcare coverage.

In this project, I aim to delve into the dataset to uncover insights about the relationships between various attributes and insurance charges. Through exploratory data analytics, statistical hypothesis testing, and modeling techniques such as linear regression, I seek to build predictive models capable of estimating insurance premium charges accurately.

## Proposed Tasks

* **Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA):** Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and uncover potential relationships between attributes and insurance charges.

* **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** Conduct hypothesis tests to determine the significance of various factors (e.g., smoker status, region) in influencing insurance premium charges.

* **Statistical Modeling:** Utilize statistical modeling techniques to build predictive models, starting with linear regression, to forecast insurance premium charges based on insured individuals' attributes.

## Methodologies

* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis for identifing factors affecting premium.
* Deploying liner regression to predict premium and finding optimal model.
* Summarize findings.

## Key Findings 

* age and smoking is one of the most influencing attributes for an increase in premium
* The number of children slightly affects the premium.
* to study outliers we don,t have enough attributes.
